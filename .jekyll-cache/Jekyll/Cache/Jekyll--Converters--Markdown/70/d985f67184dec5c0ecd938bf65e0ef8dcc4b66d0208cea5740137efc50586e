I"”<p>Hi, my name is Haowen Huang é»„æ˜Šé›¯ and I go by Claire. 
Iâ€™m set to graduate in May next year as a Media Studies and Data Science double-major at the University of California, Berkeley.
My coursework includes Data Structures, Industrial and Commercial Data Systems, Marketing, 
Principles and Techniques of Data Science, Statistical Modeling, and 
Service Operations Design and Analysis. Such interdisciplinary learning experience has inspired me to explore opportunities in busiess analytics.
Outside of classrooms, Iâ€™m a strong advocate for cultural exchanges between the US and China and represented the Project Pengyou Berkeley Chapter 19-20.</p>
