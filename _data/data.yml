    title: About Me
    summary: |
        Hi, my name is Haowen Huang 黄昊雯 and I go by Claire. 
        I'm set to graduate in May next year as a Media Studies and Data Science double-major at the University of California, Berkeley.
        My coursework includes Data Structures, Industrial and Commercial Data Systems, Marketing, 
        Principles and Techniques of Data Science, Statistical Modeling, and 
        Service Operations Design and Analysis. Such interdisciplinary learning experience has inspired me to explore opportunities in business analytics.
        Outside of classrooms, I'm passionate about the US-China cultural exchanges and represented the [Project Pengyou](https://projectpengyou.org/) Berkeley Chapter 19-20.
