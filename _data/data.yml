    title: About Me
    summary: |
        Hi, my name is Haowen Huang 黄昊雯 and I go by Claire. 
        I’m set to graduate in May 2021 as a Media Studies and Data Science double-major at the University of California, Berkeley. 
        My interdisciplinary courseworks have inspired me to apply data-driven methods to solve real-life challenges. 
        Proficient in statistical analysis tools such as Python and SQL, I've also honed efficient communication and product management skills by working cross-functionally as independently from various internship and research experiences. 
        Outside of classrooms, I’m passionate about the US-China cultural exchanges and represented the Project Pengyou Berkeley Chapter 19-20.
